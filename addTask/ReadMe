in a console application it was necessary to
write a program for working with records through memory and a file,
I write a repository to do this in parallel
while the application is running, you can both work with the file and with memory


and in the second task it was necessary to write sql queries,
I have in my file the code for creating and filling out the tables,
and the necessary code is marked with comments
