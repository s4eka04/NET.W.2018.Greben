1)jaggedArray contains code to sort the array.
there are almost no comments in it because from the name of the methods
itâ€™s clear what they do, well, I think so
there is also a method for comparing arrays. it is needed for testing
2)polynomial contains code for working with polynomial and all possible overloads for working with polynomial.
there are no more and fewer operators since polynomials cannot be compared like this


and I wrote no nunit sorry. next time I will write nunit testing
